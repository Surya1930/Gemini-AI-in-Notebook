      "\n",
      "**1. Law of Inertia:** An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by a net force.  Think of a ball sitting still, or a car moving at a steady speed on a straight road.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Law of Acceleration:** The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.  This means a bigger force makes things speed up or slow down faster, and heavier objects are harder to move.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Law of Action-Reaction:** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.  Think of jumping: you push down on the ground, and the ground pushes back up on you, propelling you into the air. \n",
      "\n",
      "These three laws form the foundation of classical mechanics, explaining how objects move and interact with each other. \n",

He wasn't just any cat; he was a time traveler, a guardian of history, with a magic collar that shimmered with celestial energy.  His latest mission: prevent the theft of the legendary Sunstone, a crystal said to hold the power of a thousand suns.\n",
      "\n",
      "He materialized in a bustling marketplace, the air thick with the scent of spices and the cacophony of hawkers.  The year was 1485, the place, the sprawling city of Alexandria.  He recognized the thief, a slithering shadow known as Scarab, notorious for his cunning and swiftness.  Scarab, with eyes like molten gold, was already making his way towards the Temple of Ra, where the Sunstone lay guarded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Midnight, a blur of ginger fur, slipped through the crowded streets, his senses alert.  He reached the temple just as Scarab, cloaked in darkness, was about to break through the temple's ornate doors.  He hissed, a sound that echoed with surprising power, startling the thief.\n",

      "\"You may be fast, Scarab, but I am faster,\" he meowed, his voice echoing with the ancient wisdom of ages.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ensuing chase was a whirlwind of feline grace and shadowy cunning. Midnight, utilizing the architectural nuances of the temple and his feline agility, kept Scarab at bay.  He led the thief on a dizzying pursuit, through intricate corridors and hidden chambers, finally cornering him in the sanctum where the Sunstone rested.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scarab, cornered and desperate, unleashed a burst of dark magic.  The chamber shook, and the air crackled with sinister energy.  But Midnight, undeterred, faced him with a newfound intensity.  He closed his eyes, focusing on the collar's magic, its celestial energy surging through him. \n",
      "\n",
      "With a powerful hiss, he unleashed a wave of pure light, dispelling the dark magic and throwing Scarab back.  The thief, weakened and defeated, fled into the shadows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Midnight, his chest heaving, approached the Sunstone, a radiant orb pulsing with golden light.  He felt its warmth, its power, and understood the responsibility entrusted to him. He knew he would return to his own time, but the memory of this adventure, of protecting the Sunstone and safeguarding history, would forever be etched in his feline heart.\n",

He knew, as he disappeared into the ethereal vortex, that his journey, and his duty, were far from over.

      "\n",
      "1. **Function Definition:**\n",
      "   - `def fibonacci(n: int) -> int:` defines a function named `fibonacci` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns an integer. The type hints (`int`) improve code readability and help with static analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Base Case:**\n",
      "   - `if n <= 1:` checks for the base cases where the Fibonacci sequence starts:\n",
      "     - `return n` returns 0 for `n = 0` and 1 for `n = 1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Recursive Step:**\n",
      "   - `else:` handles the recursive case for `n > 1`:\n",
      "     - `return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)` recursively calls the `fibonacci` function with `n-1` and `n-2` to calculate the previous two Fibonacci numbers and adds them together.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Modularity:**\n",
      "- The function is self-contained and performs a single, well-defined task: calculating the nth Fibonacci number.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Readability:**\n",
      "- Clear function name (`fibonacci`) and docstring explaining the function's purpose, arguments, return value, and examples.\n",
      "- Type hints (`int`) improve code readability and help with static analysis.\n",
      "- Indentation and spacing enhance code readability.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Performance:**\n",
